// Host side of the Typst preview stream: one websocket leg per guest to the running preview
// task's data plane (held in electron main), spliced to that guest's sealed session frames.
//
// The GUEST owns each connection's lifecycle - it opens with a fresh `conn` epoch and recovers
// from anything (relay drop, gap, host preview restart) by closing and reopening. This side only
// answers: dial a leg on 'open', forward bytes both ways while it lives, and say 'close' when the
// socket dies. tinymist treats every data-plane connection as a fresh viewer and starts it with a
// whole-document frame, which is what makes reattach a complete recovery and retransmission
// unnecessary.
//
// Demand flows the other way too: a guest can ask for the preview while the host has its own pane
// closed, so `demand` is surfaced for WorkspaceView to keep the preview task alive whenever legs
// exist. The task itself (start/kill, its address) stays WorkspaceView's; it reports the address
// here via setHost.
