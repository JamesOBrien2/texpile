// knows which is which, and the sender (WorkspaceView's caret debounce) has no reference to the
// frame. This store is the wire between them: the sender bumps it, TypstPreview forwards a
// `quiet` message into the frame, and the bridge there swallows ripples for the next half second.

 * the asking guest, the host's OWN pane holds a direct socket the relay never sees. TypstPreview
 * forwards this as a `freeze` message and the page bridge swallows jump/cursor frames for the
 * window - so a guest following its caret does not drag the host's view around.
